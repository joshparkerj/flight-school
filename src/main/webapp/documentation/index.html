		<h2>Documentation</h2>
		<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
		<p>Flight School API has all the information you could want about
			Flight School&trade;, a totally legitimate institution of
			higher-learning. This documentation should help you familiarize
			yourself with the resources available and how to consume them with
			HTTP requests. If you have problems, all I can say is just keep
			trying things and never give up!</p>
		<h4 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h4>
		<p>Let's make our first API request to the Flight School API!</p>
		<p>Just paste the url for whatever resource you want into your
			browser address bar! It is also possible to use curl, or a great API
			tool like Postman. Personally, I recommend using the Google Chrome
			browser with the JSONView extension installed. It makes browsing our
			API a breeze!</p>
		<p>Try visiting the API endpoint for the Boeing 747:</p>
		<code class="block-code">http://flightschool.joshquizzes.com/flightschool/api/aircraft/14/</code>
		<p>Here is the response we get:</p>
		<code class="block-code"> { id: 14, name: "Boeing 747-400",
			certs: "airliner, jet", pilot_count: 7, url:
			"https://flightschool.joshquizzes.com/flightschool/api/aircraft/14/",
			pilots: [ { id: 11, name: "Anne "Hollywood" Neven", dob:
			"1998-05-17", sex: "female", url:
			"https://flightschool.joshquizzes.com/flightschool/api/pilot/11/",
			age: 20, aircraft_count: 12 }, { id: 31, name: "Hannah "Typhoon"

		<h4 id="baseurl">Base URL</h4>
		<p>
			The <strong>Base URL</strong> is the root URL for all of the API. It
			is
			<code class="block-code">https://flightschool.joshquizzes.com/flightschool/api/</code>
			The documentation below assumes you are prepending the Base URL to
			the endpoints in order to make requests.
		</p>
		<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
		<p>
			Flight School&trade; provides a <strong>completely open API</strong>.
			No authentication is required to query and get data. This also means
			that you are limited to <strong>GET</strong> requests. If you find a
			mistake in the data, feel free to laugh at our mistake and feel very
			superior. There's no charge for schadenfreude!
		</p>
		<h4 id="jsonschema">JSON Schema</h4>
		<p>
			All resources support <a href="https://jsonschema.net">JSON
				Schema</a>. Making a request to
			<code>/api/&lt;resource&gt;/schema</code>
			will give you the details of that resource. This will allow you to
			programmatically inspect the attributes of that resource and their
			types.
		</p>
		<h4 id="searching">Searching</h4>
		<p>
			All resources support a
			<code>search</code>
			parameter that filters the set of resources returned. This allows you
			to make queries like:
			<code>https://flightschool.joshquizzes.com/flightschool/api/pilot/?search=maverick</code>
			.
		</p>
		<p>All searches will use case-insensitive partial matches on the
			resources name.</p>
		<h3>Encodings</h3>
		<h4 id="json">JSON</h4>
		<p>All api responses will be JSON-formatted.</p>
		<h3>Resources</h3>
		<h4 id="root">Root</h4>
		<p>The Root resource provides information on all available
			resources within the API.
		<h4 id="pilots">Pilots</h4>
		<p>The Pilot resource provides information on all of the pilots
			who have totally earned their certifications from Flight
			School&trade;.</p>
		<h4 id="certifications">Certifications</h4>
		<p>The Certification resource lists all of the completely
			legitimate certifications that we award to the dedicated pilots who
			have graduated from Flight School&trade;.</p>
		<h4 id="aircraft">Aircraft</h4>
		<p>The Aircraft resource lists all of the aircraft which our
			completely capable and reliable pilots can be certified to fly.</p>
